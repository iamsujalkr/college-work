            <b><i>India</i></b>, officially the <b>Republic of India (Bhārat Gaṇarājya)</b>, is a country in South Asia. 
            It is the <u>seventh-largest</u> country by area; the most populous country as of June 2023; and 
            from the time of its independence in 1947, the world's most populous democracy. Bounded by
            the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal on the 
            southeast, it shares land borders with Pakistan to the west; China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the 
            north; and Bangladesh and Myanmar to the east. In the Indian Ocean, India is in the vicinity
            of Sri Lanka and the Maldives; its Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with
            Thailand, Myanmar, and Indonesia.

            India has been a federal republic since 1950, governed through a democratic parliamentary system. 
            It is a pluralistic, multilingual and multi-ethnic society. India's population grew from 361 million
            in 1951 to almost 1.4 billion in 2022. During the same time, its nominal per capita income 
            increased from US$64 annually to US$2,601, and its literacy rate from 16.6% to 74%. From being 
            a comparatively destitute country in 1951, India has become a fast-growing major economy
            and a hub for information technology services, with an expanding middle class. India has a 
            space programme with several planned or completed extraterrestrial missions. It is the fourth 
            country to land a craft on the moon and the first to do so within 600 kilometres (370 mi) of the 
            Lunar south pole. Indian movies, music, and spiritual teachings play an increasing role in global 
            culture. India has substantially reduced its rate of poverty, though at the cost of increasing 
            economic inequality. <mark>India is a nuclear-weapon state</mark>, which ranks high in military expenditure. 
            It has disputes over Kashmir with its neighbours, Pakistan and China, unresolved since the mid-20th 
            century. Among the socio-economic challenges India faces are gender inequality, child malnutrition, 
            and rising levels of air pollution. India's land is megadiverse, with four biodiversity 
            hotspots. Its forest cover comprises 21.7% of its area. India's wildlife, which has 
            traditionally been viewed with tolerance in India's culture, is supported among these forests, 
            and elsewhere, in protected habitats.
